# 1D Marathon
Repository for the source codes for 1D Marathon for all platforms.
Considering this is the first game I ever worked on I suggest to NOT use any code from here, as it can be considered bad code, and it may have bad code practices.
## PC
The PC variant was made using Game Maker Studio 2 v2.3.0.529.
